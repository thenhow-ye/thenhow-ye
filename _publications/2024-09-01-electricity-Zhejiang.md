excerpt: 'This paper reveals that the allocation of electricity resources across different regions is operated by central SOEs rather than government department, influenced not only by the degree of top-down centralization of SOEs (construction in "planned economy period" or "reform period"), but also by the bottom-up proactive bargaining from local governments (level of electricity demand driven by economic growth).'

**Abstract:** Tiao (sector) systems such as electricity and railways cannot bypass the kuai (territorial administration) in the process of their development. While some tiaos were able to establish vertical systems of service provision in many localities, the same service has instead been provided by kuai in other localities. Focusing on the historical evolution of the electricity system at county-level in Zhejiang province, China, this paper seeks to explain the variations in such sectoral-territorial embeddedness. The level of embeddedness was not only affected by the particular historical environment when the tiao sought to expand, but also by the level of development of kuai. The findings of the paper have practical implications for understanding the state-owned enterprises reform through the perspectives of central-local, and tiao-kuai relationships.
