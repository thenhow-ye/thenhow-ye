**Abstract:** While scholars have explored the political and social consequences of natural disasters, few provide systematic evidence on the effect of recurrent disasters on the state capacity at the subnational level. To answer this question, this paper conducts a study based on a unique county-level dataset of all coastal typhoon landfalls in China from 1949 to 2019. By constructing a quasi-natural experiment based on the presence or absence of typhoon landfalls, this paper systematically estimates the impact of these disasters on local state capacity, considering: (1) landfall frequency, (2) damage intensity, and (3) spatial spillover effects. Results indicate that such shocks contribute to the enhancement of subnational state capacity formation, rather than causing destructions. Further mechanism analysis reveals that moderate natural disaster shocks foster infrastructure accumulation and post-disaster mobilization, while excessive shocks can have detrimental effects. These findings provide systematic evidence on the role of natural disasters as “exogenous shocks” in shaping state capacity, offering implications for subnational political and economic development.
