**Abstract:** This paper develops a typology of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by integrating crucial political economy theories related to bureaucracy and corporation giants, including institutionalism, welfare state, developmental state, and shortage economy. By categorizing roles of SOEs based on dimensions of “operational goals” (economic growth or resource distribution) and “level of local embeddedness” (high or low), this paper identifies four ideal types: paternal (e.g., Soviet-style industrial enterprises), quasi-governmental (e.g., public utilities), commercial (e.g., large business conglomerates), and developmental (e.g., high-tech and military industries). Comparing SOEs from China with those from U.S., U.K., Japan, South Korea, and former Soviet Union, this paper classifies 98 Central SOE in China into these four categories, providing a comprehensive understanding of their roles in the political economy.

**Key Words:** State-owned Enterprise; Comparative Political Economy; Policy Goal; Embeddedness
