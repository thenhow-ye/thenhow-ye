excerpt: 'This paper attempts distinguish roles of state-owned enterprises (SOE) by integrating some crucial political economy theories related to bureaucracy and corporation giants, including institutionalism (Evans, 1989; Olson, 1982; Smith, 1776), welfare state (Esping-Andersen, 1990; Polanyi, 1944; Schumpeter, 1942), developmental (Amsden, 1989; Gerschenkron, 1962; Jonson, 1982; Wade, 1990; Woo-Cumings, 1999), and shortage economy (Kornai, 1980, 1986; Lin et al., 1998; Lin et al., 1999). Based on dimensions of "policy goals" (growth or security) and "the level of bureaucratic embeddedness" (high or low), this paper classifies roles of state-owned enterprises into four ideal types: parternal (e.g., Soviet-style enterprises), quasi-governmental (e.g., electricity, telecommunications, and railways sectors), commercial (e.g., large business conglomerates), and developmental (e.g., high-tech and military industries). Employing empirical evidence from China, this paper also illustrates the typology by classfying 98 Central SOE in China into the aforementioned four categories.'
