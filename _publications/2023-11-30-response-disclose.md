**Abstract:** Government's continuous responsiveness is regarded as a crucial feature of modern political systems. In the context of non-democratic regimes, scholars have discussed government responsiveness to heterogenous interests through “top-down” and “bottom-up” mechanisms by introducing particular policies. However, few concerns about government responsiveness to citizen needs in everyday governance based on relevant laws and regulations. Focusing on government responses to “information disclosure request”, this paper conducts an experimental design and categorizes government responses from different prefectural governments to the same disclosure request into four types: service-oriented, procedural, referral, and non-response. Analysis reveals that “migrant population size” significantly influences local government responsiveness, with citizens from cities with higher “migrant population ratios” are more likely to receive service-oriented responses. Additionally, “elite networks” and “collective action pressure” serve as important moderating factors in this relationship.
