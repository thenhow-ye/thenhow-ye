**Abstract:** Why do people turn to God? Individuals often turn to religion to cope with unbearable and unpredictable life events. When facing major dsasters, does increased religious devotion contradict secular confidence in life? This study uses survey data collected before and after the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake in China to address this question through a natural experimental design. The research finds that, temporally, external natural disasters significantly increase public religious devotion in the short tern; spatially, regions with higher earthquake risks exhibit greater levels of religious devotion. Additionally, earthguake risk has a significant impact on public religious devotion and future expectations, with this impact showing a hierarchical structure. Media exposure also plays a crucial mediating rle in this process. The study also analyzes heterogeneity across different demographic groups. Our research contributes valuable insights into the shifts in people's beliefs during major disaster impacts.
