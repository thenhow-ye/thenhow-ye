**Abstract:** This study explores the sources of state capacity in government-invested infrastructure projects. Building an original county-level dataset that containing 3,444 hydropower stations constructed between 1953 and 2020 in contemporary China, findings indicate that the construction of hydropower stations is likely to strengthen the capacity of penetration and extraction on the county-level. This pattern is robust after accounting for a series of tests and an instrumental variable approach that exploits topographic variations. Additional typical within-case study suggests that the construction of infrastructural projects requires the establishment of grassroots administrative authorities to comprehend various aspects of the society and the increase in taxation to guarantee logistical support for construction. After the completion of construction, institutions serve the project are perpetuated, resulting the enhancement of penetrative and extractive capacity on the county-level. These findings highlight the potential political consequences of infrastructural projects.
