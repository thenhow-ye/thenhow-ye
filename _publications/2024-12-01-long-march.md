**Abstract:**  For revolutionary regimes, the most critical issue is the transition from “seizing the state” to “governing the state.” This study explores the sources of legitimacy of revolutionary regimes in government-invested infrastructure construction. Using GIS technology and historical archives, this study builds an original dataset on the geographic regions traversed by the Red Army during the Long March from 1934 to 1936. The findings indicate that counties crossed by the Red Army or formerly designated as revolutionary bases before 1937 are more likely to receive the central government's support for rural electrification. This pattern remains robust across propensity score matching, instrumental variable approaches, and a range of alternative explanations and robustness checks. Additional case studies suggest that this pattern stems most likely from the state's top-down policy-driven assistance to regions where the ruling party conducted revolutionary activities before seizing the state power. These findings contribute to the literature on state-building and local political-economic development, and highlight how revolutionary regimes strategically allocate policy resources across regions to bolster its legitimacy.
