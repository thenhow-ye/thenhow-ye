Welcome! I am Renhao Ye, a Graduate Student of Political Science at Peking University. My primary research interests lie in political economy of development, state-owned enterprise, Chinese politics, and comparative political institutions.

My research addresses the questions of power sharing among political actors, and how their interactions, in turn, shape policy outcomes. My research stresses the roles of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in resource allocation and subnational state-building, particularly in the Chinese context. I focus on why and how SOEs identify, address, and coordinate the distribution issues of infrastructure construction and public service provision across different regions, as well as the political and economic consequences of the unevenness distribution of policy resources.

In addtion to distributive politics and state capacity, I am also working on [topics](http://thenhow-ye.github.io/publications/) including the political and economic implications of natural disasters. My work has appeared in conferences such as _APSA (American Political Science Association) Annual Meeting_, _SPSA (Southern Political Science Association) Annual Conference_, and _CCPSIS (Chinese Community of Political Science and International Studies) Annual Meeting_. I, along with my coauthor, also collect several datasets on infrastructure construction and natural disasters in contemporary China.

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Political Science and Double Bachelor's Degree in Economics from Peking University.
